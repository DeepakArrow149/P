# Timeline Task Overlap Fix Implementation

## Problem
Multiple tasks assigned to the same resource at overlapping time periods were visually overlapping and obscuring each other in the planning board timeline, making them difficult to interact with.

## Solution Implemented
Added an intelligent vertical stacking system that detects overlapping tasks and positions them at different vertical levels (stack levels) to prevent visual overlap.

## Key Changes Made

### Modified File: `timeline-schedule-pane.tsx`

1. **Replaced Simple Task Mapping with Intelligent Stacking**
   - Changed from a simple `.map()` that rendered all tasks at the same vertical position
   - Implemented a two-phase approach: first calculate all task positions, then apply stacking

2. **Overlap Detection Algorithm**
   - Uses a time-unit-based occupancy tracking system
   - For each time unit, tracks which stack levels are occupied
   - Finds the lowest available stack level for each task's entire duration

3. **Vertical Positioning System**
   - Tasks are stacked vertically when they overlap horizontally
   - Each stack level adds vertical offset: `taskTop + (stackLevel * (height + 2))`
   - Slight height reduction for stacked tasks to fit more in the same space
   - 2px gap between stacked tasks for visual separation

## Algorithm Details

### Step 1: Task Position Calculation
```typescript
// Calculate task positions (left, width, startIndex, endIndex)
const resourceTasks = tasks
  .filter((task) => task.resourceId === resource.id)
  .map((task) => {
    // Calculate horizontal position and time indices
    // Filter out invalid tasks
  })
  .filter(Boolean);
```

### Step 2: Vertical Stacking
```typescript
// Track occupied levels for each time unit
const occupiedLevels: Array<Set<number>> = [];

for (const taskData of resourceTasks) {
  let stackLevel = 0;
  
  // Find lowest available stack level
  while (true) {
    let levelAvailable = true;
    
    // Check if level is free for entire task duration
    for (let unitIndex = taskData.startIndex; unitIndex <= taskData.endIndex; unitIndex++) {
      if (occupiedLevels[unitIndex]?.has(stackLevel)) {
        levelAvailable = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (levelAvailable) {
      // Reserve this level for task duration
      for (let unitIndex = taskData.startIndex; unitIndex <= taskData.endIndex; unitIndex++) {
        occupiedLevels[unitIndex] = occupiedLevels[unitIndex] || new Set();
        occupiedLevels[unitIndex].add(stackLevel);
      }
      break;
    }
    
    stackLevel++;
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Render with Adjusted Positions
```typescript
// Apply vertical stacking
const adjustedHeight = Math.max(12, taskHeight - Math.min(stackLevel * 2, 8));
const adjustedTopMargin = taskTop + (stackLevel * (adjustedHeight + 2));
```

## Benefits
1. **No Visual Overlap**: Tasks are clearly separated vertically
2. **Maintains Chronological Accuracy**: Horizontal positioning unchanged
3. **Optimal Space Usage**: Uses lowest available stack level
4. **Performance Optimized**: O(n²) complexity with early termination
5. **Type Safe**: Proper TypeScript typing with null checks

## Visual Result
- **Before**: Tasks at same time overlapped completely
- **After**: Tasks stack vertically like cards, each clearly visible and clickable

## Compatibility
- Works with both daily and hourly timeline views
- Maintains all existing task interaction capabilities
- Preserves task dimensions and styling
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Safety Features
- Stack level limit (max 10) prevents infinite loops
- Height constraints ensure tasks remain visible
- Proper null/undefined checks for type safety
- Graceful degradation if positioning fails

This implementation provides a clean, efficient solution to the task overlap problem while maintaining the existing functionality and user experience of the planning board timeline.

## Issue 2: Task Strip Extension Fix (Fixed)

### Problem
Task strips were extending beyond the visible timeline area, going into regions that should not be rendered. This occurred when tasks had end dates that extended past the currently displayed timeline units.

### Root Cause
The width calculation logic was using `taskEndUnitIndex` directly without checking if it exceeded the bounds of the visible timeline:

```tsx
const width = (taskEndUnitIndex - taskStartUnitIndex + 1) * unitCellWidth;
```

When a task extended beyond the displayed units, `taskEndUnitIndex` could be larger than necessary, causing the task strip to render beyond the visible area.

### Solution
Implemented boundary checking by clamping the task end index to stay within the visible timeline bounds:

```tsx
// Clamp the task end index to stay within the visible timeline bounds
const clampedTaskEndIndex = Math.min(taskEndUnitIndex, displayedUnits.length - 1);

const left = taskStartUnitIndex * unitCellWidth;
const width = (clampedTaskEndIndex - taskStartUnitIndex + 1) * unitCellWidth;
```

### Key Changes
1. **Boundary Validation**: Added `Math.min()` to ensure task end index never exceeds `displayedUnits.length - 1`
2. **Width Calculation Fix**: Use clamped end index for width calculation to prevent strips extending beyond visible area
3. **Consistent Return Data**: Use clamped index in the returned task data for consistency

### Impact
- ✅ Task strips no longer extend beyond the visible timeline area
- ✅ Maintains correct visual representation within timeline boundaries
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality for normally-sized tasks
- ✅ Compatible with the existing overlap stacking system

### Code Location
File: `d:\Planner React\src\components\plan-view\timeline-schedule-pane.tsx`
Lines: ~325-350 (task positioning logic)

This fix ensures that task strips are always contained within the intended timeline viewport, preventing visual overflow issues.
