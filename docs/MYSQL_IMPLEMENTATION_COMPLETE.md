# MySQL Database Connectivity Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of MySQL database connectivity for all master modules in the production planning system, replacing the mock services with real database connections.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Database Connection Handling**
   - Updated all repository methods to properly handle MySQL connection pools
   - Implemented the correct pattern: `const pool = await getConnection(); const connection = await pool.getConnection();`
   - Added proper connection release in finally blocks

2. **Standardized Interfaces**
   - Created a unified `interfaces.ts` file to export consistent interfaces for all modules
   - Fixed inconsistencies between mock services and repositories
   - Resolved type issues to ensure compile-time safety

3. **Resolved Property Naming Issues**
   - Fixed the `isActive` vs `active` parameter inconsistency in filters
   - Made both parameter names work for backward compatibility
   - Updated parameter handling in API hooks and repositories

4. **Removed Invalid Properties**
   - Removed `groupCode` property from mock services that didn't match repository interfaces
   - Updated methods to work with the correct property set

## Implementation Details

### Connection Handling
All repository methods now follow this pattern:
```typescript
async methodName(params): Promise<ReturnType> {
  const pool = await getConnection();
  const connection = await pool.getConnection();
  try {
    // Database operations
    // ...
    return result;
  } finally {
    connection.release();
  }
}
```

### Interface Standardization
Created a central `interfaces.ts` file to ensure consistent types across:
- Repository definitions
- Mock services
- API hooks

### Filter Compatibility
Made filter parameters work with both naming conventions:
```typescript
if (filters.isActive !== undefined) {
  query += ' AND isActive = ?';
  params.push(filters.isActive);
} else if (filters.active !== undefined) {
  query += ' AND isActive = ?';
  params.push(filters.active);
}
```

## Testing
To test the database connectivity:
1. Ensure MySQL server is running
2. Check database connection configuration in `database.ts`
3. Use the API endpoints to verify data is being saved and retrieved properly

## Next Steps
- Implement additional repositories for other master modules
- Add error handling middleware 
- Create data migration tools if needed
