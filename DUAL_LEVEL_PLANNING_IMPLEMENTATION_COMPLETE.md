# Dual-Level Planning Board Implementation - COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Full implementation of the enhanced dual-level Planning Board system for the Planner React application.

## Architecture Overview

The system provides two distinct planning views:

### 1. High-Level Planning Board (Strategic View)
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning for managers and planners
- **Timeline**: Weekly/monthly view with capacity allocation
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop order allocation across timeline
  - Line capacity heatmap with color-coded status
  - Style-level filters (Buyer, Factory, SAM range, Search)
  - Milestone tracking (Cutting Start, Sewing Start, Ex-Factory)
  - Alert system for fabric shortage, over-capacity, line idle, delivery risk
  - Three-tab interface: Timeline, Capacity, Alerts & Milestones

### 2. Low-Level Planning Board (Execution View)
- **Purpose**: Day-to-day production execution monitoring
- **Timeline**: Daily/hourly shift view
- **Features**:
  - Day/Shift view with granular production blocks
  - Real-time operator mapping and attendance tracking
  - Hourly progress tracking with target vs actual performance
  - Bottleneck detection and delay reasoning system
  - WIP indicators and efficiency monitoring
  - Four-tab interface: Day/Shift View, Operator Mapping, Progress Tracking, Bottlenecks & Issues

## Technical Implementation

### Type System Extension âœ…
- Extended `SubProcessViewMode` type in `types.ts`
- Added `'high-level-planning'` and `'low-level-planning'` modes
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing modes

### Component Architecture âœ…
- **HighLevelPlanningBoard.tsx**: Strategic planning component
- **LowLevelPlanningBoard.tsx**: Execution monitoring component
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Extensive mock data demonstrating full feature set

### Integration Points âœ…

#### 1. Main Page Integration
- Updated `src/app/plan-view/page.tsx` with conditional rendering
- Added component imports
- Enhanced localStorage support for new planning modes

#### 2. Toolbar Integration
- Enhanced `timeline-toolbar.tsx` with new dropdown options
- Added Target and Zap icons for visual distinction
- Proper disabled state handling

#### 3. Navigation Flow
- Seamless switching between planning board modes
- State persistence across sessions
- Consistent UI/UX with existing application

```

## File Structure

```
src/components/plan-view/
â”œâ”€â”€ HighLevelPlanningBoard.tsx     âœ… Strategic planning interface
â”œâ”€â”€ LowLevelPlanningBoard.tsx      âœ… Execution monitoring interface
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts                       âœ… Extended type definitions
â””â”€â”€ timeline-toolbar.tsx           âœ… Enhanced with planning board options

src/app/plan-view/
â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                       âœ… Main page with conditional rendering
```

## Data Structures

### High-Level Planning Types
```typescript
- StyleOrder: Order management with allocation status
- Milestone: Project milestone tracking
- Alert: System alert with severity levels
- LineCapacityData: Production line capacity information
- WeeklyTimelineData: Timeline allocation data
```

### Low-Level Planning Types
```typescript
- ShiftData: Shift-level production information
- HourlyTarget: Hourly production targets and actuals
- Bottleneck: Bottleneck identification and analysis
- DelayReason: Delay cause tracking
- OperatorAssignment: Operator-to-line mapping
```
