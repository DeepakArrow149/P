## 🔧 Technical Implementation Summary

### Stacking Algorithm
```tsx
// Occupancy tracking per time unit
const occupiedLevels: Array<Set<number>> = [];

for (const taskData of resourceTasks) {
  let stackLevel = 0;
  
  // Find lowest available stack level for this task's time range
  while (true) {
    let levelAvailable = true;
    
    // Check if this stack level is free for the entire task duration
    for (let unitIndex = taskData.startIndex; unitIndex <= taskData.endIndex; unitIndex++) {
      if (!occupiedLevels[unitIndex]) occupiedLevels[unitIndex] = new Set();
      if (occupiedLevels[unitIndex].has(stackLevel)) {
        levelAvailable = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    
    if (levelAvailable) {
      // Mark this level as occupied for the task's duration
      for (let unitIndex = taskData.startIndex; unitIndex <= taskData.endIndex; unitIndex++) {
        if (!occupiedLevels[unitIndex]) occupiedLevels[unitIndex] = new Set();
        occupiedLevels[unitIndex].add(stackLevel);
      }
      break;
    }
    
    stackLevel++;
    if (stackLevel > 10) break; // Safety check
  }
  
  stackedTasks.push({ ...taskData, stackLevel });
}
```

### Boundary Checking
```tsx
// Clamp the task end index to stay within the visible timeline bounds
const clampedTaskEndIndex = Math.min(taskEndUnitIndex, displayedUnits.length - 1);

const left = taskStartUnitIndex * unitCellWidth;
const width = (clampedTaskEndIndex - taskStartUnitIndex + 1) * unitCellWidth;
```

### Visual Positioning
```tsx
const adjustedHeight = Math.max(12, taskHeight - Math.min(stackLevel * 2, 8));
const adjustedTopMargin = taskTop + (stackLevel * (adjustedHeight + 2)); // 2px gap
```

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### ✅ Overlap Resolution
1. **Intelligent Stacking**: Tasks automatically stack vertically when they overlap horizontally
2. **Occupancy Tracking**: Each time unit tracks which stack levels are occupied using `Set<number>`
3. **Level Assignment**: Algorithm finds the lowest available stack level for each task
4. **Visual Spacing**: 2px gaps between stacked tasks with slight height reduction
5. **Safety Limits**: Maximum 10 stack levels to prevent infinite loops

### ✅ Boundary Protection
1. **Clipping Logic**: Tasks extending beyond visible timeline are clipped at boundary
2. **Width Calculation**: Uses clamped end index to prevent overflow
3. **Consistent Data**: Return data uses clamped index for consistency
4. **Layout Safety**: Prevents strips from rendering outside container bounds

### ✅ Compatibility
1. **Drag & Drop**: Maintains compatibility with existing drag-and-drop functionality
2. **Task Interactions**: All existing task interactions (context menu, dialogs) work unchanged
3. **Performance**: Efficient algorithm with minimal computational overhead
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compatibility with proper null checks
