### 4. Enhanced Order Management
- **Detailed Order Cards**: Priority badges, product information, quantities, and SAM ranges
- **Individual Line Assignment**: Each order gets its own line selection interface
- **Selected Line Preview**: Shows factory path and line details when selected

### 5. Real-time Allocation Summary
- **Factory-wise Grouping**: Orders grouped by assigned factory for easy overview
- **Live Updates**: Summary updates as allocations are made
- **Validation**: Prevents scheduling until all orders have line assignments

### 6. Advanced User Experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Shows relevant information at each step
- **Smart Button States**: Confirm button shows remaining unassigned orders count
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Detailed success messages with allocation breakdown

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Components Enhanced

#### LineCapacityData Interface
```typescript
interface LineCapacityData {
  lineId: string;
  lineName: string;
  factory: string;      // NEW
  unit: string;         // NEW  
  lineType: string;     // NEW
  capacity: number;
  allocated: number;
  utilization: number;
  status: 'available' | 'tight' | 'overloaded';
  efficiency: number;
}
```

#### Enhanced Mock Data
- **Factory A**: 3 lines (2 Sewing, 1 Cutting) across 2 units
- **Factory B**: 2 lines (1 Finishing, 1 Assembly) across 2 units  
- **Factory C**: 3 lines (1 Sewing, 1 Cutting, 1 Finishing) across 3 units

#### State Management
```typescript
const [showBulkScheduleDialog, setShowBulkScheduleDialog] = useState(false);
const [orderLineAllocations, setOrderLineAllocations] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
```

#### Helper Functions
- `handleLineAllocation()`: Manages order-to-line assignments
- `handleConfirmBulkSchedule()`: Validates and processes bulk scheduling
- `organizedLines`: Computed property for hierarchical line organization

### Dialog Structure

#### Left Panel: Order Management
- Selected orders list with detailed information
- Individual line assignment dropdowns
- Real-time allocation feedback

#### Right Panel: Production Lines Overview  
- Factory-grouped line display
- Capacity and utilization indicators
- Live allocation counters

#### Footer: Actions & Summary
- Cancel and Confirm buttons
- Smart validation feedback
- Allocation summary display

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

- Detailed success feedback with factory-wise breakdown

### 4. Responsive Design
- Optimized for large datasets with scrollable sections
- Grid-based layout adapting to different screen sizes
- Clean separation of information hierarchy

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Script Created
- `test-enhanced-bulk-scheduling.js`: Comprehensive validation script
- Tests dialog structure, allocation functionality, and user workflow
- Automated validation of enhanced features
