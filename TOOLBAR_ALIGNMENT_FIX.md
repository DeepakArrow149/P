# Planning Board Toolbar Alignment Fix

## Issue Identified
The planning board toolbar was not properly aligned from left to right. The toolbar layout had alignment issues where components were not organized in a clear left-to-right structure.

## Root Cause
The original toolbar structure used:
- A single flex container with `justify-between` 
- Two main sections without proper center alignment
- Missing proper flex properties for balanced layout

## Solution Implemented
Restructured the toolbar into **three distinct sections** with proper flex alignment:

### 1. Left Section - Plan Management (flex-shrink-0)
- Plan Actions dropdown
- Plan selector 
- Unplanned button
- Search button
- Quick find input

### 2. Center Section - Main Controls (flex-1 justify-center)
- Save button
- Sub-Process dropdown
- Timeline view controls (Zoom, View Mode, Color options)
- Row height controls
- Timeline navigation (Previous/Next periods, Today)
- Filter controls
- Maximize/Minimize controls

### 3. Right Section - Help & Settings (flex-shrink-0)
- Help button
- More options dropdown

## Key CSS Changes Applied

```tsx
// Main container
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-2 border-b bg-card flex-shrink-0 shadow sticky top-0 z-30 h-14">

// Left section
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-shrink-0">

// Center section  
<div className="flex items-center gap-1 flex-1 justify-center px-4">

// Right section
<div className="flex items-center gap-1 flex-shrink-0">
```

## Benefits of the Fix
1. **Proper left-to-right alignment**: Clear visual hierarchy from left to right
2. **Responsive design**: Components adjust properly on different screen sizes
3. **Balanced spacing**: Center section takes available space with proper justification
4. **No wrapping issues**: flex-shrink-0 prevents unwanted wrapping of essential controls
5. **Better UX**: Users can easily find controls in their expected locations

## Files Modified
- `src/components/plan-view/timeline-toolbar.tsx` - Main toolbar component restructured

## Testing Recommended
1. Verify toolbar appears properly aligned on desktop
2. Test responsiveness on mobile/tablet views
3. Ensure all buttons and dropdowns function correctly
4. Check that no visual regressions occur in other planning board components

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Toolbar alignment issue fixed and ready for testing
