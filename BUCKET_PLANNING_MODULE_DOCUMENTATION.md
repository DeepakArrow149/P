# 🪣 Bucket Planning Module: Centralized Manufacturing Control Center

## Overview

The **Bucket Planning** module serves as the centralized control center for all manufacturing factories and their production lines, providing an intuitive, container-based approach to production capacity management. This module transforms the complex task of production planning into a visual, easy-to-understand system using the powerful metaphor of physical buckets.

## 🔧 Core Concept: The Container Metaphor

### What is a "Bucket"?

Think of a **bucket** as a visual, container-like element within the software where unscheduled orders are collected and tracked. Just like a physical bucket that can hold a certain amount of water before overflowing, each production bucket has a defined capacity that represents the maximum production volume it can handle.

#### Visual Bucket Representation

```
🪣 Production Bucket (Line A - Sewing)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ │ 75% Full
│ Current: 750 pcs | Capacity: 1000  │
│ Available: 250 pcs remaining       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Physical Bucket Analogy

- **Empty Bucket (0-25%)**: 🟢 Plenty of room for new orders
- **Quarter Full (25-50%)**: 🔵 Good capacity available
- **Half Full (50-75%)**: 🟡 Moderate capacity remaining
- **Nearly Full (75-95%)**: 🟠 Limited space, approaching capacity
- **Overflowing (100%+)**: 🔴 Bucket is full and spilling over

## 🏭 Capacity Allocation System

### Line Groups to Bucket Assignment

Production capacity is intelligently distributed across buckets through our **line group** allocation system:

#### 1. **Volume Production Bucket** 🏭
- **Connected Lines**: L1, L2, L6 (High-volume production lines)
- **Combined Capacity**: 3,300 pieces/day
- **Specialization**: Standard, high-volume manufacturing
- **Bucket Metaphor**: Large industrial container for bulk orders

#### 2. **Specialty Manufacturing Bucket** 🎨
- **Connected Lines**: L3, L7 (Custom production lines)
- **Combined Capacity**: 1,550 pieces/day
- **Specialization**: Custom and complex orders
- **Bucket Metaphor**: Precision container for specialized items

#### 3. **Finishing Operations Bucket** ✨
- **Connected Lines**: L4, L8 (Finishing lines)
- **Combined Capacity**: 1,550 pieces/day
- **Specialization**: Surface treatment and finishing
- **Bucket Metaphor**: Refinement container for quality enhancement

#### 4. **Assembly & Packaging Bucket** 📦
- **Connected Lines**: L5 (Assembly line)
- **Combined Capacity**: 600 pieces/day
- **Specialization**: Final assembly and packaging
- **Bucket Metaphor**: Completion container for final processing

## 📊 Dynamic Capacity Visualization

### Real-Time Fill Level Indicators

The software provides sophisticated visual representations of each bucket's current status:

#### Progressive Fill Visualization
```css
/* Bucket Fill Levels */
.bucket-empty {      /* 0-25%  */ background: linear-gradient(to-right, #10b981, #059669); }
.bucket-quarter {    /* 25-50% */ background: linear-gradient(to-right, #3b82f6, #2563eb); }
.bucket-half {       /* 50-75% */ background: linear-gradient(to-right, #f59e0b, #d97706); }
.bucket-full {       /* 75-95% */ background: linear-gradient(to-right, #ef4444, #dc2626); }
.bucket-overflow {   /* 100%+  */ background: linear-gradient(to-right, #991b1b, #7f1d1d); }
```

#### Percentage-Based Status Display

**Fill Level Calculation:**
```typescript
const fillPercentage = (currentOrders / totalCapacity) * 100;
const status = {
  0-25%:   "🟢 Empty - Ready for orders",
  25-50%:  "🔵 Quarter Full - Good availability", 
  50-75%:  "🟡 Half Full - Moderate capacity",
  75-95%:  "🟠 Nearly Full - Limited space",
  100%+:   "🔴 Overflowing - Exceeds capacity"
};
```

### Advanced Capacity Indicators

#### 1. **Animated Progress Bars**
- Smooth fill animations showing real-time capacity changes
- Color transitions based on utilization levels
- Gradient effects for visual appeal

#### 2. **Threshold Markers**
- **50% Marker**: First capacity checkpoint
- **75% Marker**: Caution threshold
- **100% Marker**: Maximum capacity line

#### 3. **Numerical Displays**
- Current utilization percentage
- Absolute quantities (pieces scheduled vs. capacity)
- Remaining available capacity

## 🧮 Capacity Calculation Logic

### Total Bucket Capacity Formula

**Core Principle**: A bucket's total capacity equals the sum of all connected production lines.

```typescript
// Capacity Calculation Example
const volumeProductionBucket = {
  lines: ['L1', 'L2', 'L6'],
  capacities: [1000, 1200, 1100], // pieces per day
  totalCapacity: 1000 + 1200 + 1100 = 3300, // pieces per day
  currentOrders: 2400, // pieces scheduled
  utilization: (2400 / 3300) * 100 = 72.7%, // fill percentage
  available: 3300 - 2400 = 900 // pieces remaining
};
```

### Multi-Line Aggregation

When multiple production lines feed into a single bucket:

1. **Capacity Summation**: Individual line capacities are added together
2. **Load Distribution**: Orders can be allocated across any connected line
3. **Optimal Routing**: System suggests best line assignment based on:
   - Current utilization levels
   - Line specialization
   - Order requirements
   - Efficiency curves
