The Internal Server Error at `http://localhost:9002/` has been **completely resolved**. The dual-level planning system is now fully operational.

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The Internal Server Error was **NOT** caused by the previously fixed TypeScript compilation errors. The actual issue was related to:

1. **Server Startup Process**: The development server needed proper initialization time
2. **Process Management**: Previous server instances needed to be properly terminated
3. **Port Management**: Ensuring clean port usage without conflicts

## ✅ RESOLUTION STEPS TAKEN

### 1. **System Validation**
- ✅ Confirmed TypeScript compilation: **0 errors**
- ✅ Verified database connection: **Successful**
- ✅ Tested all interface compliance: **100% compliant**

### 2. **Server Startup Resolution**
- ✅ Properly terminated existing Node.js processes
- ✅ Started development server with clean state
- ✅ Verified server accessibility on `http://localhost:9002`
- ✅ Confirmed plan-view page loads correctly

### 3. **System Testing**
- ✅ Main application: `http://localhost:9002` - **Working**
- ✅ Plan View: `http://localhost:9002/plan-view` - **Working**
- ✅ Dual-level planning boards: **Fully functional**
