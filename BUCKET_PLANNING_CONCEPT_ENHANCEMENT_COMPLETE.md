## ✅ What Was Updated

### 1. **Enhanced Card Title & Description**
- **Updated Title**: "Unscheduled Orders - Bucket Planning"
- **Comprehensive Description**: Added detailed explanation of bucket planning concept
- **Business Context**: Explained why bucket planning is essential for garment manufacturing

### 2. **Detailed Business Concept Explanation**
The instructions section now includes four comprehensive information panels:

#### 🏭 **Why Bucket Planning for Garment Industry?**
- High order variability (style, size, fabric)
- Frequent changes from buyers
- Dependence on pre-production (fabric, trims, approvals)
- Line efficiency variation per product
- Explanation of why precise scheduling is impractical

#### ✅ **Key Concepts in Bucket Planning**
- **Bucket**: Time slot for allocating production work
- **Line Capacity**: Total available SAMs or pieces per day
- **Order Allocation**: Dividing workload across days and lines
- **Efficiency**: Line efficiency for calculating output
- **Overload**: When allocated work exceeds capacity

#### 🧾 **Practical Example**
- **Real Scenario**: Line 1, 60% efficiency, 8 hours/day, 20 operators
- **Calculation Process**: 
  - Line capacity = 20 × 480 × 0.60 = 5,760 minutes/day
  - Required SAMs = 1,000 × 20 = 20,000 SAMs
  - Days needed = 20,000 ÷ 5,760 ≈ 3.47 days
- **Result**: Order allocation across 4 buckets
